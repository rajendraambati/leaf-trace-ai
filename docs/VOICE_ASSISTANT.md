## Technical Implementation

### Edge Functions

#### `unified-assistant`
- Main AI orchestration function
- Gathers context from relevant database tables
- Uses Lovable AI (Gemini 2.5 Flash) for responses
- Suggests actionable commands based on context
- Implements empathetic fallback messages

#### `text-to-speech`
- Converts text to speech using OpenAI TTS
- Voice: Alloy (default)
- Model: tts-1-hd
- Output: MP3 format, base64 encoded

#### `assistant-actions`
- Executes actions suggested by the assistant
- Server-side validation and security
- Direct database operations via Supabase
- Returns structured results

### Database Context

The assistant automatically gathers relevant context:
- **Orders**: `erp_procurement_orders` with dispatches
- **Compliance**: `compliance_documents` by entity name
- **Vehicles**: `vehicles` with maintenance schedules
- **Shipments**: `shipments` with status tracking
- **Reports**: `regulatory_reports` by date
- **Documents**: `generated_documents` by type/status
- **Warehouses**: `warehouses` with inventory

### Security

- **JWT Authentication**: All functions require valid auth tokens
- **RLS Policies**: Data filtered by user permissions
- **Role-Based Access**: Context limited to user role
- **Secure Actions**: Server-side validation for all operations

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Dispatcher Query
**User**: "Show me all vehicles that need service"

**Assistant**: "I'm checking our maintenance schedules... I found 3 vehicles requiring service:
- VH-001: Oil change due in 2 days
- VH-005: Tire rotation overdue by 1 week  
- VH-009: Annual inspection due tomorrow

Would you like me to schedule these services?"

**Actions**: 
- [View VH-001 Details]
- [View VH-005 Details]
- [View VH-009 Details]

### Example 2: Compliance Query
**User**: "Validate BG for SIT Arabian Contracting"

**Assistant**: "I'm looking for Bank Guarantee information for SIT Arabian Contracting... I found their compliance record:
- Entity: SIT Arabian Contracting
- BG Status: Valid
- Expiry Date: 2025-12-31
- Amount: $250,000

The bank guarantee is currently valid and compliant."

**Actions**:
- [View Full Compliance Record]
- [Download BG Document]

### Example 3: Warehouse Query
**User**: "Which warehouses are running low on stock?"

**Assistant**: "Checking inventory levels across all warehouses... I found 2 warehouses with low stock:
- Dubai Warehouse: 15% capacity (1,500 kg / 10,000 kg)
- Sharjah Warehouse: 22% capacity (2,200 kg / 10,000 kg)

Would you like to initiate a restock order?"

**Actions**:
- [View Dubai Warehouse]
- [View Sharjah Warehouse]
- [Create Restock Order]

## Empathetic Responses

When data is missing, the assistant provides helpful alternatives:

**Instead of**: "No data found"

**It says**: "I'm checking our system for that information, but I don't see it in recent records. It might have been completed already, or the reference number might be slightly different. Can you double-check the details?"

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Conversation persistence (save to database)
- [ ] Multi-language support
- [ ] File attachment support
- [ ] Screenshot analysis
- [ ] Voice command shortcuts
- [ ] Assistant customization (voice, personality)
- [ ] Usage analytics and insights
- [ ] Proactive suggestions based on patterns
- [ ] Integration with external APIs
- [ ] Custom action definitions per user

## Configuration

### Environment Variables Required
- `LOVABLE_API_KEY` - For AI responses
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` - For TTS and voice features
- `SUPABASE_URL` - Database connection
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` - Admin database access

### Supabase Config
All assistant functions are configured in `supabase/config.toml`:
```toml
[functions.unified-assistant]
verify_jwt = true

[functions.text-to-speech]
verify_jwt = true

[functions.assistant-actions]
verify_jwt = true
```

## Best Practices

1. **Keep queries specific** - Include IDs, names, or dates for better results
2. **Use suggested queries** - Pre-configured for optimal results
3. **Enable voice output** - Better multitasking while listening
4. **Export important conversations** - Save for reference or documentation
5. **Use keyboard shortcuts** - Faster access to assistant
6. **Execute suggested actions** - One-click to perform tasks
7. **Provide feedback** - Help improve AI responses

## Troubleshooting

### Voice not working
- Check microphone permissions in browser
- Verify OpenAI API key is configured
- Check browser console for errors

### Actions not executing
- Verify JWT token is valid
- Check user has required permissions
- Ensure database connection is active

### Slow responses
- May indicate API rate limiting
- Check network connection
- Try text chat instead of voice

### Context not loading
- Verify RLS policies allow data access
- Check user role permissions
- Review edge function logs
